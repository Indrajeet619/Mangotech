IBM call for code

We are creating super APP for farmers to solve different problems they face. Firstly,we have developed smoke fire detection using computer vision system. We have trained AI model using smoke and fire photos and videos. Any camera can be installed in farms at high location and AI continuously monitor for smoke or fire detection. Camera gives range of 10 to 15 km to cover forest area. 

Also we have developed IOT device for bee farming. Device monitors temperature, humidity and Co2 levels in bee hives and farmer can get all information about hives on website. Also farmers can get email alerts if bee hives has reached critical levels of temperature or humidity. 

Food prices in regions like Ukraine and Eastern Europe has been increased, so we have developed platform that small farmers can sell their produce at low cost to end users. Our app is specially made for Ukraine and end user can get huge savings on groceries as well as food waste is reduced. 
So we have developed super app to solve farmers problem at various stages of their production
