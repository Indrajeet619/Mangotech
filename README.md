IBM call for code

Forest fire causes huge biodiversity loss as well as economy loss . According to studies, small farmers in developing countries lose about 37 Billion USD every year. So we have developed smoke fire detection using computer vision system. We have trained AI model using smoke and fire photos and videos. Any camera can be installed in farms at high location and AI continuously monitor for smoke or fire detection. Camera gives range of 10 to 15 km to cover forest area. 

Also we have developed another feature such that farmer can upload his location and get probability of wildfire prediction in his location. By using Nasa dataset and Ibm weather api , we obtained data and have trained AI model on parameters like temperature, wind, humidity, etc which gives wildfire prediction so farmer can prepare himself. 

Bees play important role in developing biodiversity. They help in pollination and also help in farming. But Bees honey can get affected by temperature and humidity. Bee farmers donâ€™t have time to manually check bee hives, so we have developed iot device that monitors temperature, humidity and Co2 levels in bee hives and farmer can get all info about hives on website. Also Co2 levels can monitor air quality in hive and also help in detecting unexpected fires in bee hive. We have used IBM code engine, database, IBM weather api, esp32 microcontroller, dht11 temperature and humidity sensor and CO2 sensor.
