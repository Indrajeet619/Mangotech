We have developed IOT device for bee farming that uses storj data storage. Bees play important role in developing biodiversity. They help in pollination and also help in farming. But Bees honey can get affected by temperature and humidity. So we have developed iot device that monitors temperature, humidity and Co2 levels in bee hives and information gets stored in storj. And farmers can get all information about hives on website. IOT devices are scattered across various regions and decentralized storage service of Storj provides good solution. Decentralizations for IOT devices helps against security hacks and also provide better uptime time than centralized storage. Hence farmers can get better security and good speed for their IOT devices in bee farming. Here IOT device sends info like temperature and humidty to node js server then server converts this info  to text file and uploads to storj. We have used aws sdk library to upload file to storj. As you can see files from different IOT devices have been uploaded to Storj. Each file contains information about temperature, humidity and CO2 levels 

So by using our IOT device, Bee farmers donâ€™t have to manually check bee hives, also farmers can get email alerts if bee hives has reached critical levels of temperature or humidity. And storj provides decentralization that helps against security hacks and also provide better uptime. We have used storj DCS, esp32 microcontroller, dht11 temperature, humidity sensor and CO2 sensor.
